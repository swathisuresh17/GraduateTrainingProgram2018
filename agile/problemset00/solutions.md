/*1)How does agile testing (development) methodology differ from other testing (development) methodologies?*/

In other testing methodologies the end user gets to see only the product, while in agile, it emphasizes the rapid delivery of an application in complete functional components.

In other testing methodologies all Developers and customers agree on what will be delivered early in the development lifecycle. 

While in Agile the customer has frequent and early opportunities to see the work being delivered,
and to make decisions and changes throughout the development project.

In other testing methodologies a customer presence is not strictly required after the requirements phase.

In Agile development is often more user-focused, likely a result of more and frequent direction from the customer.

/*2)What are the most important components of Agile?*/

1.Attain customer satisfaction through continuous delivery of software.

2.Don't be afraid to make changes.

3.Deliver working software, with a preference to the shorter timescale

4. Developers and management must work together 

5.Build projects around motivated individuals

6.Face-to-face interactions are the most efficient & effective modes of communication 

7.Working software is the primary measure of progress

8.Agile processes promote sustainable development

9.Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility

10.Simplicity is essential

11.The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams

12.Inspect & Adapt


/*3)What is difference between Epic,features, User stories & Tasks?*/
Epic-An epic is a large user story that can be split into smaller user stories.

Features-Elements of functionality 

User story-The team divides up the work to be done into functional increments called user stories.Each user story is expected to contribute to the value of the overall product, irrespective of the order of implementation.

Tasks- The responsibilities that are assigned.

/*4)Explain what is a product backlog in Scrum.*/

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product.The Product Owner is responsible for the 
Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.

The Product Backlog evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful.

/*5)What is Scrum Sprint?*/

Scrum Sprint is a repeatable fixed time-box during which a "Done" product of the highest possible value is created


/*6)What are the artifacts of Scrum process?*/

Product Backlog

Sprint Backlog

Increment


/*7)What do you understand by sprint backlog?*/

The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.

The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that can be understood but the Team to track in the Daily Scrum. 


/*8)What is the role of the Product Owner?*/

The product owner role was established in order to provide that single source of information for a product development team about the product they are trying to build.  

Product owner checks the accpetance criteria.


/*9)What are the different roles in Scrum.*/

-The Scrum Team

-Scrum Master

-Scrum Product Owner

/*10)What are the responsibilities of a Scrum Master*/

He enables close cooperation across all roles and functions, addresses resource issue and disobedience of scrum practices.

He removes impediments so the team can focus on the work at hand and follow scrum practices.

/*11)What are different ceremonies and their importance in Scrum?*/

Planning day-The first day of sprint is the planning day.

Demo day-The demonstration of  finished work within the iteration, and get immediate feedback from project stakeholders. 

Stand up/Scrum call-Stand-up is designed to quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team. It's not a detailed status meeting. 

Sprint retrospective-Retrospectives help the team understand what worked wellâ€“and what didn't and to find out what's working so the team can continue to focus on those areas.
Also, find out what's not working and use the time to find creative solutions and develop an action plan. 


/*12)What is the difference between Sprint Planning Meeting and Sprint Retrospective Meeting?*/

The sprint planning meeting is attended by the product owner, ScrumMaster and the entire Scrum team.The product owner describes the highest priority features to the team.

The sprint retrospective is a meeting facilitated by the Scrum Master at which the team discusses the just-concluded sprint and determines what could be change that might make the next sprint more productive.  

/*13)What is the difference between agile & scrum?*/

-Agile is a SDLC mehtodlogy based on iterative and incremental approach.Scrum is one of the implementations of agile methodology.

-Agile software development has been widely seen as highly suited to environments.Scrum is ideally used in the project where the requirement is rapidly changing.

-Agile involves collaborations and face-to-face interactions between the members of various cross-functional teams.In Scrum collaboration is achieved in daily stand up meeting with a fixed role assigned to scrum master, product owner, and team members.

-Deliver and update the software on a regular basis.I Scrum the team is done with the current sprint activities, the next sprint can be planned.
